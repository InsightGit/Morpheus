----------------------------------
Installing the DevKitPro toolchain
----------------------------------

Before downloading Morpheus, we need to install the
DevKitPro toolchain that will be used to cross-compile our
code for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) and the DS. In order to install
the necessary components needed, follow
`this guide <https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started>`_ and make sure
to install the GBA and the DS (or NDS) developer libraries (also known
as gba-dev and nds-dev).

-------------------
Installing Python 3
-------------------

For many of the build scripts to function, a working Python 3 installation
is needed. While the scripts have only been tested on Python 3.8 and Python
3.9, any Python version above 3.6 should work fine (If you still run
into trouble with 3.6 or 3.7, install one of the tested versions).
You can install Python from `The Python Software Foundation's website
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or through your preferred package
manager.
